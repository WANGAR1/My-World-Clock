# My-World-Clock

This is WANGAR1's end of Phase 1 project.
So for my final project of this first pahse I created a clock by using the timezonedb. 
Well technically not just a normal clock but also a world clock that gives you current time of any city, by city I mean eaxamples like New York, London, Nairobi, Pretoria, Addis Ababa, Chicago etc, so not just capital cities but also actual cities. 
As I was saying, it'll helps us get current time, it also helps us get time in chosen timezone( EAT,GMT etc), it helps us convert time and lets us put chosen cities in a favorite list.
The timezonedb gave me access to three things :

1. List Time Zone.
2. Get Time Zone.
3. Convert Time Zone.
